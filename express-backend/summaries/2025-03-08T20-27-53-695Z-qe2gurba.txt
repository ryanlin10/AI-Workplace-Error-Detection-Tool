Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're describing a situation where two patients have very different characteristics or behaviors, and you're saying it's fine or not a big deal. I don't have enough context to provide a more detailed response, but I'm happy to continue the conversation if you'd like to elaborate further on what you're referring to.
